sudo apt-get install dnsmasq

Consider a script /usr/local/bin/myedit. Add the user into the group myeditors, or if it really will ever only be a single user, change the %myeditors value to the username. Using visudo add this line to the sudoers file

%myeditors ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/myedit

Now create the script /usr/local/bin/myedit, remembering to make it executable (chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/myedit).
